Vocabulary:

- condition: something that evaluates to a boolean

- boolean: something that is true or false

- conditional branching: a choice that is made based on whether a condition is true or false

- flow control: tools/mechanisms programmers use to determine when and how code runs

- if/elsif/else: if code will run if condition is true, elsif will run if previous if is false and current condition is true, else will run if no previous conditions are true

- loop: a set of instructions that will run repeatedly until a condition is met

- while: a set of instructions that runs as long as a condition is true

- until: a set of instructions that runs until a condition is true

- times: executes instructions a set number of times, can include a block variable to count which iteration it is in

- infinite loop: a set of instructions that will run forever and ever, unless you use break

- break: a keyword that ends an infinite loop, can use conditionals with break to determine when loop ends

Rules:

- conditional branches will have exactly 1 if
- any number of elsifs
- 0 or 1 else
- always ends with an end (in ruby)
- only one branch can run
- conditions are evaluated in order
